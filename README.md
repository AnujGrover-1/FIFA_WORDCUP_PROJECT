TODO - So in this project I will try to analyse the datasets of FIFA Worldcup, wherein I will try to find which country hosted most of the matches, which city hostes maximum matches, which country won the maximum matches and the worldcup, etc. I will be using Pandas library for manipulation of data and matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualization of the dataset.
